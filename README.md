# Tableau-Dashboards
 Overview:
This repository contains two Tableau data visualization case studies —
Titanic Dataset – focused on survival analysis and demographic insights.
Coffee Chain Dataset – focused on business performance, profitability, and sales analysis.
Both projects demonstrate hands-on Tableau visualizations, data interpretation, and insights from real-world datasets.

Case study 1 : Titanic 

Objective:
To visualize and analyze passenger demographics and survival patterns using Tableau.

Tasks Performed:
Bar chart – Passenger count by gender
Stacked bar chart – Survival count by gender
Bar chart – Survival rate by passenger class
Histogram – Age distribution of passengers
Bar chart – Average fare by class
Scatter plot – Fare vs. Age
Bar chart – Passenger count by embarkation port
Heatmap – Survival rate by gender and class
Box plot – Age vs. Survival

Steps Summary:
Drag and drop required fields (e.g., Sex, Age, Survived, Pclass) into Tableau.
Adjust aggregations such as Count or Average.
Use Show Me to select appropriate visual types.
Customize colors and labels for better readability.
Pie chart – Distribution by gender or other dimensions

Key Insights:
Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.
First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
Majority of passengers were aged between 20–40 years.
Higher ticket fares corresponded to higher survival chances.

Case Study 2 : Coffee Chain

Objective:
To perform business analysis using the Coffee Chain dataset in Tableau, focusing on sales, profit, marketing, and regional insights.

Tasks Performed:
Heat map – Product Type, State, and Profit
Box plot – Sales distribution for Espresso products
Bar chart – Product Type vs. Product vs. Profit
Scatter plot – State vs. Sales vs. Profit
Identify highest and lowest profit states
Sales in Nevada for Decaf Espresso
Tea’s contribution (%) to overall profit
Average marketing for area codes 660 & 818
Highest and lowest profit products in California
Side-by-side circles – Minimum marketing for Colombian Coffee Beans
Tree map – Market with maximum budget sales
Sales contribution for Decaf (East market, 2012)
Average profit for products starting with “C”
Top 5 Products by Sales (%) in Central region
Highest profit state in West market (2013)
Expenses-to-sales ratio for lowest-profit state
Distinct area codes for lowest budget margin (small markets)
% of profit for Caffe Mocha (Major Market, 2013)
Month/year when Decaf sales crossed $1,100 in Colorado & Florida

 Steps Summary:
Use dimensions such as State, Market, Product Type, Sales, Profit, and Marketing.
Create calculated fields for percentages, ratios, and average measures.
Use filters and highlights for product-specific and time-based insights.
Utilize chart types like Heatmaps, Boxplots, Bar Charts, Treemaps, and Scatter Plots for analysis.

Key Insights:
Espresso products had varying profit margins across states.
Western markets showed the highest overall profits.
Tea contributed a moderate percentage to total profit.
Marketing expenditure varied significantly by area code.
